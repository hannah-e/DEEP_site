Differences in DNA methylation patterns are associated with a range of measures of health and disease. We believe that we can find new ways to understand health and disease by looking at how genetics and the environment affect DNA methylation across the human population.</p> <p>By studying people living around the world, we can understand how diverse genetics and environment affect DNA methylation. We know that some diseases affect people living in different global regions in different ways.
