We know that some diseases affect people living in different global regions in different ways. By understanding mechanisms of variation in DNA methylation and how this is associated with health and disease, we can work on strategies to make healthcare more equal for everyone.</p>"},{"location":"Research/#how-we-will-do-it","title":"How we will do it:","text":"<p>We will work collaboratively with partners around the world who have collected data on DNA methylation, genetics and measures of health and disease.
